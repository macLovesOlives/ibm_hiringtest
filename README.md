WHAT?
-------
Twitter Talk is a nodejs application that when given a keyword will pull a set of matching tweets.  The number of tweets and the type of tweets (most recent vs most popular) can be specified through the application.  When the tweets are displayed to the screen the application also displays an analysis of the feelings in the tweet.  This sentiment is rated on a 5 point scale.  These emotions are displayed via corresponding emojis.  
-2 : very sad 
-1 : sad
0  : neutral
1  : happy
2  : very happy
  
Known Bugs:
-----------
  Some webbrowsers and operating systems do not support emoji display, although most do.  If you cannot see the emoji's it is most likely due to a lack of support from the browser, try Chrome or a mobile browser.
